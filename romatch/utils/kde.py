    """
    A fast version of KDE that computes the pairwise squared Euclidean distances
    using matrix multiplications rather than torch.cdist. This should be faster
    than the original if memory permits.

    This version computes:

        dist_sq = ||x||^2 + ||x2||^2.T - 2 * (x @ x2.T)
        scores = exp(-dist_sq / (2*std^2))
        density = scores.sum(dim=-1)

    Args:
        x (torch.Tensor): Input tensor of shape [N, d].
        std (float): Standard deviation for the Gaussian kernel.
        half (bool): Whether to convert x to half precision.
        down (int or None): If provided, use x[::down] as the second argument.

    Returns:
        torch.Tensor: A tensor of shape [N] containing the density estimates.
